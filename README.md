    -   #### Typography
        -   The Oswald font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

Paytone One is also used for some headers & titles as it is a bold & dominant font.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The main banner image is a man lifting weights to represent fitness & excerise, it also complements the color scheme with a deep red tone.
